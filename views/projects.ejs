      <h1>Wayland Compositer</h1>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          Wayland is a fantastic protocal, and even in its early stages it seems
          the clear replacement for the atavistic X protocal that is still commonplace
          today. Unfortunately, applications that support Wayland tend to be less
          stable and to have less extensive documentation than their time-tested X
          counterparts. The goa; of this project is to create a simple, high-quality,
          well-documented Wayland compositer that will provide the Wayland community
          with the tools it needs to realize its potential.
